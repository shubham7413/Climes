        Since the mid 19th century, the level of carbon emissions in our
        atmosphere has increased by 50%. This is causing the Earth‚Äôs temperature
        to rise, resulting in countries across the globe experiencing the severe
        impacts of climate change. If we don‚Äôt take action to limit our carbon
        emissions now, we will be heading towards a massive climate disaster. In
        the words of the IPCC Report - this is CODE RED for humanity!
      </p>
      <p>
        You may already know that burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and
        natural gas releases carbon emissions into the atmosphere. But many
        other activities in our lives also emit carbon and contribute to climate
        change - even attending an online event like this one!
      </p>
      <p>
        With Climes, we can educate ourselves about the negative impacts we are
        having on our planet - and take action to neutralise this.
        ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur‚Äù has chosen to do something
        positive for our environment by making this event carbon neutral. Below
        is a breakdown of where the carbon emissions are coming from, and how
        your ticket purchase is helping GES achieve its commendable goal.

        the event!
